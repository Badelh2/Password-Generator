Welcome to the Password Generator!

This program is designed to generate random and secure passwords for you to use on websites and applications. It uses Python to generate the passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

To use the program, simply run the script and follow the prompts. You will be asked to specify the length of the password you want to generate and the number of passwords you want to generate. The program will then generate the requested number of passwords, each with the specified length.

Please note that the passwords generated by this program are for personal use only and should not be shared with others. It is important to use unique and secure passwords for each of your accounts to protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized access.
